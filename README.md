# File-Separator-Mid-term-JAVA-project-No-GUI
This is a simple JAVA program to separate different types of files in a directory and separate them into
different folder with user permission. 
The project contains different Class Files and a MAIN file named fileseparator.java in which all classes are imported.
The usage of project is to scan a directory, recognize and count all files in that directory. If directory contains files in it then program
will tell total number of files in it and total number of each type of file in it. Then it will ask for separating each kind of file to a
different new folder which will be made by program itself and it will move all single type of files into new folder if user give permission
to move files and similarly program will ask for other files.
